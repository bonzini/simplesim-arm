- Alpha instruction set extensions (MVI, BWX, AMASK, IMPLVER, etc...)
- extensive extensions to the Alpha OSF system call model (from Calder,
  Plakal, Austin, etc...)
- 21-bit conditional branch offset fix
- divide by zero allowed for floating point operations
- sim-outorder now stops after sim_num_insn
- DECLARE_FAULT fixed in jump table version of sim-fast
- myprintf() buffer overflows less likely
- options package now uses correct precision when printing double's
- pipetrace.pl now works with perl 5.x
- cross-endian execution support added (w/ limited syscall support)
- debug mode support restored in sim-outorder
- sigreturn event tracing now works
- event tracing (EIO) now works for traces longer than 2^32 insts
- periodic checkpointing (-perdump) support added to sim-eio
- renice support no longer interferes with extern renice mechanisms
- decoders are more bulletproof (check for array overflows)
- speculative execution should now be deterministic (uninit bugs fixed...)
- sim-outorder now limits execution to number of non-spec insts (!spec)
- added retirement tracing to sim-outorder (enable with -v)

TO TEST:

	- same-endian vs. cross-endian
	- live syscalls vs. EIO traces
	- Alpha vs. PISA
	- tests vs. SPEC

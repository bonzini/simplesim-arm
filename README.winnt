As of SimpleScalar 3.0, the SimpleScalar simulator (for PISA or Alpha)
should build out-of-the-box for MS VC++ and Cygnus/Win32 on Windows NT.

NOTE: due to bugs in MS VC++ __int64 support, MS VC++ version 5.0 plus
service pack 3 (or later) is required to build SimpleScalar/Alpha.

NOTE1: the SimpleScalar PISA compiler tools will not build on Windows NT.
Either build the binaries on another little-endian supported platform,
or grab them from the binaries release available from the same place
you found this package.

There are some deficiencies with this port; specifically, some of the
system calls made by SimpleScalar PISA or Alpha OSF binaries have no
obvious counterparts under WinNT (e.g., getrusage()), when these system
calls are made, a warning is printed.  A better way to use SimpleScalar
on Windows NT is to rely completely on extern I/O traces (EIO traces).
Generate these on a more capable host and then run them on Windows NT.
Since only file I/O is required to run an EIO trace, any tracable program
can later re-run under Windows NT.  See README.eio for details...

Steve Reinhardt ported the simulators to the WinNT/Cygnus environment.  Thanks!

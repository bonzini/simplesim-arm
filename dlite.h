/*
 * This module implements DLite, the lite debugger.  DLite is a very light
 * weight semi-symbolic debbugger that can interface to any simulator with
 * only a few function calls.  See sim-safe.c for an example of how to
 * interface DLite to a simulator.
 *
 * The following commands are supported by DLite: 
 *

 *
 * help			 - print command reference
 * version		 - print DLite version information
 * terminate		 - terminate the simulation with statistics
 * quit			 - exit the simulator
 * cont {<addr>}	 - continue program execution (optionally at <addr>)
 * step			 - step program one instruction
 * next			 - step program one instruction in current procedure
 * print <expr>		 - print the value of <expr>
 * regs			 - print register contents
 * mstate		 - print machine specific state (simulator dependent)
 * display/<mods> <addr> - display the value at <addr> using format <modifiers>
 * dump {<addr>} {<cnt>} - dump memory at <addr> (optionally for <cnt> words)
 * dis <addr> {<cnt>}	 - disassemble instructions at <addr> (for <cnt> insts)
 * break <addr>		 - set breakpoint at <addr>, returns <id> of breakpoint
 * dbreak <addr> {r|w|x} - set data breakpoint at <addr> (for (r)ead, (w)rite,
 *			   and/or e(x)ecute, returns <id> of breakpoint
 * breaks		 - list active code and data breakpoints
 * delete <id>		 - delete breakpoint <id>
 * clear		 - clear all breakpoints (code and data)
 *
 * ** command args <addr>, <cnt>, <expr>, and <id> are any legal expression:
 *
 * <expr>		<- <factor> +|- <expr>
 * <factor>		<- <term> *|/ <factor>
 * <term>		<- ( <expr> )
 *			   | - <term>
 *			   | <const>
 *			   | <symbol>
 *			   | <file:loc>
 *
 * ** command modifiers <mods> are any of the following:
 *
 * b - print a byte
 * h - print a half (short)
 * w - print a word
 * q - print a qword
 * t - print in decimal format
 * u - print in unsigned decimal format
 * o - print in octal format
 * x - print in hex format
 * 1 - print in binary format
 * f - print a float
 * d - print a double
 * c - print a character
 * s - print a string

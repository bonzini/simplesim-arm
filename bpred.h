 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2000/11/29 14:53:54  cu-cs
 * Grand unification of arm sources.
 *
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2000/05/26 15:18:57  taustin
 * SimpleScalar Tool Set
 *
 *
 * Revision 1.5  1998/08/31 17:12:11  taustin
 * eliminated unportable "uint" reference
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1998/08/27 08:00:15  taustin
 * implemented host interface description in host.h
 * explicit BTB sizing option added to branch predictors, use
 *       "-btb" option to configure BTB
 * return address stack (RAS) performance stats improved
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  1997/05/22 18:04:05  aklauser
 *
 * Revision 1.8  1997/05/01 20:23:06  skadron
 * BTB bug fixes; jumps no longer update direction state; non-taken
 *    branches non longer update BTB
 *
 * Revision 1.7  1997/05/01 00:05:51  skadron
 * Separated BTB from direction-predictor
 *
 * Revision 1.6  1997/04/29  23:50:44  skadron
 * Added r31 info to distinguish between return-JRs and other JRs for bpred
 *
 * Revision 1.5  1997/04/29  22:53:10  skadron
 * Hopefully bpred is now right: bpred now allocates entries only for
 *    branches; on a BTB miss it still returns a direction; and it uses a
 *    return-address stack.  Returns are not yet distinguished among JR's
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1997/04/28  17:37:09  skadron
 * Bpred now allocates entries for any instruction instead of only
 *    branches; also added return-address stack
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1997/04/24  16:57:27  skadron
 * Bpred used to return no prediction if the indexing branch didn't match
 *    in the BTB.  Now it can predict a direction even on a BTB address
 *    conflict
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1997/03/25 16:17:21  skadron
 * Added function called after priming
 *

/*
 * This module implements a number of branch predictor mechanisms.  The
 * following predictors are supported:
 *
 *	BPred2Level:  two level adaptive branch predictor
 *
 *		It can simulate many prediction mechanisms that have up to
 *		two levels of tables. Parameters are:
 *		     N   # entries in first level (# of shift register(s))
 *		     W   width of shift register(s)
 *		     M   # entries in 2nd level (# of counters, or other FSM)
 *		One BTB entry per level-2 counter.
 *
 *		Configurations:   N, W, M
 *
 *		    counter based: 1, 0, M
 *
 *		    GAg          : 1, W, 2^W
 *		    GAp          : 1, W, M (M > 2^W)
 *		    PAg          : N, W, 2^W
 *		    PAp          : N, W, M (M == 2^(N+W))
 *
 *	BPred2bit:  a simple direct mapped bimodal predictor
 *
 *		This predictor has a table of two bit saturating counters.
 *		Where counter states 0 & 1 are predict not taken and
 *		counter states 2 & 3 are predict taken, the per-branch counters
 *		are incremented on taken branches and decremented on
 *		no taken branches.  One BTB entry per counter.
 *
 *	BPredTaken:  static predict branch taken
 *
 *	BPredNotTaken:  static predict branch not taken
 *
